## 为什么要摘录
一次偶然的机会，看了乔布斯2005年在斯坦福大学毕业典礼上的讲话([视频地址](http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMjk4Mzk4Mjg0.html))，他讲了三个故事，非常有深意，我很受鼓舞，所以就花时间把讲话的内容摘录下了，虽然前后花了3个多小时，但这一定是值得的。

## 讲话内容

### 开场白
- Thank You. I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world.

谢谢。今天很荣幸能和你们一起参加世界上最好大学的毕业典礼。
 
 
- Truth be told I nerver graduated from college and this is the closest I've erver gotten to a college graduation.

说实话，我没有从大学毕业，这是我离大学毕业最近的一刻。
 
 
- Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That's it. No big deal. Just three stories.

今天我要告诉你，我的生命中的三个故事。就是这样。没什么大不了的。短短三个故事。

 
### 第一个故事：连接点
The first story is about connecting the dots.

第一个故事是关于连接点。
 
I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 mounths, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit.

我在里德(Reed college)待了六个月就办休学了。随后徘徊在那里，直到18个月后才真正退学。
 
 
So why did I drop out?

我为什么退学呢？
 
 
It started before I was born.

是这样的在我出生之前。
 
 
My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption.

我的亲生母亲是一个年轻的、未婚的学生，她决定让别人收养我。
 
 
She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college fraduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife.

这个必须是个大学毕业生，所以我出生时她就准备让我被一对律师夫妇收养。
 
 
Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl.
但是这对夫妻到了最后一刻反悔了,他们想收养女孩。
 
So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking:"We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?"
所以在等待收养名单上的一对夫妻，我的养父母在一天半夜里养父母接到一通电话，还有一个，你们要认养他吗？
 
They said:"Of course." My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school.
他们说：“当然”。我的生母后来发现，我的父母从来没有从大学毕业和我的父亲从来没有从高中毕业。
 
She refused to sign the final adoption papers.
她拒绝签署最后的收养文件。
 
She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would go to college. This was the start in my life.
几个月后，我的养父母承诺将来一定让我上大学。这是我生命中的开始。
 
And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition.
17年后，但是当时我无知选了一所学费几乎跟斯坦福一样贵的大学，我那工薪阶层的父母所有积蓄都花在我的学费上。
 
After six months, I couldn't see the value in it.
六个月后，我看不出念这个书的价值何在。
 
I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out.
我不知道这辈子要干什么，也不知道念大学能对我有什么帮助。
 
And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved
their entire life.
而且我为了念这个书，花光了我父母这辈子的所有积蓄。
 
So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK.
所以我决定休学，相信船到桥头自然直。
 
It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made.
当时这个决定看来相当可怕，但回过头来看，这是我做过最好的决定之一。
 
The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.
当我休学之后，我再也不用上我没兴趣的必修课，把时间拿去听那些我有兴趣的课。
 
It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms, I returned coke bottles for the 5 cent deposits to buy food with and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple.
这一点也不浪漫。我没有宿舍，所以我睡在朋友房间的地板上，靠着回收可乐空罐的五美分买吃的。每个星期天晚上得走七里的路，晚上得到一个好好吃一顿在Hare Krishna temple。
 
I loved it.
我爱这个。
 
And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on.
后来我无意中发现后，我所驻足的大部分事物，都成了无价之宝。
 
Let me give you one example: Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction int the country.
举例来说：当时里德学院有着大概是全国最好的书法专业。
 
Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed.
整个校园的每一个海报，每一个抽屉上的每一个标签都是美丽的手写字。
 
Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this.
因为我退学，不必正常上课，我决定学书法。
 
I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great.
我学到了serif和san serif字体，学到在不同字母组合间变更字间距，学到活版印刷伟大的地方。
 
It was beautiful,historical,artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating.
书法的美好、历史感与艺术感是科学所无法捕获的。我觉得那很迷人。
 
None of this had even a hope of。
我没预期过学的这些东西能在我生活中起些什么实际作用。
 
But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac.
但十年后，当我们在设计第一台Macintosh电脑，我想起了当时所学的东西，所以把这些东西都设计进了Mac。
 
It was the first computer with beautiful typography.
这是第一台能做出漂亮东西的计算机。
 
If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.
如果我没沉溺于那样一门课里，Mac可能就不会有多重字体跟变间距字体了。
 
And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them.
当年Windows抄袭了Mac，如果当年我没这样做，大概世界上所有的个人计算机都不会有这样的字体。
 
If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do.
如果我没有退学，不学艺术课，个人电脑可能不会有精彩的排版。
 
Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college.
当然这一切都是未知的，在大学时。
 
But it was very, very clear looing backwards ten years later.
我不能预先把点点滴滴串在一起。
 
Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking backwards.
十年后唯有未来回顾时，才会明白那些点点滴滴是如何串在一起的。
 
So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.
所以你的相信，你现在所体会的东西，将来多少回连接在一起在你的未来。
 
You have to trust in something, your gut,desting,life karma,whatever, Beleiveing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follown your heart.
你得信任某个东西，直觉，命运，生命，因缘，然而，这种作法从来没让我失望。
 
Even when it leads you off the well worn path,and that will make all the difference.
也让我的人生整个不同起来。
 
My second story is about love and loss.
